 Please report any issues in the issue tracker, with as much detail as you can provide. Detailed logs are greatly appreciated and do not reveal secret information beyond the names of your ZFS datasets and snapshots.

 ## Building/Installing From Source
 
 After cloning this repository, execute the following commands to build and install SnapsInAZfs using `make`:

     make
     make install
     #optionally, run the following to run the unit/integration tests:
     make test
 
 To install the systemd service unit for SIAZ, run `make install-service`, which ONLY installs the service unit
 to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/snapsinazfs.service`, enables it, and runs `systemctl daemon-reload`.\
 The `install-service` recipe will not build SIAZ or perform any other actions.

 For detailed installation documentation,
 including descriptions of all Makefile recipes, build configurations, and other relevant details,
 run `make help` from the repository root directory.

 The man page displayed by that make recipe is the authoritative installation guide and supercedes anything that may appear in this document, if discrepancies exist.

 ## Uninstalling

 To uninstall, run `make uninstall` from the repository root directory.\
 This will delete the executable file from `/usr/local/sbin`, delete the base configuration files from 
 `/usr/local/share/SnapsInAZfs`, delete installed man pages, and update the mandb accordingly.\
 This will not remove any local configuration files in `/etc/SnapsInAZfs`.\
 This will also not remove the last build artifacts created by `make install`, nor will it uninstall the service,
 if it has been installed. To do so, either run `make uninstall-service` or `make uninstall-everything`.
 
 To uninstall the systemd service unit for SIAZ, run `make uninstall-service`, which stops the service unit,
 disables it (to remove alias symlinks), removes the service unit file from /usr/lib/systemd/system/snapsinazfs.service,
 and runs `systemctl daemon-reload`.

 To clean all build artifacts, run `make clean`.\
 To clean specific build target target artifacts, run `make clean-release` or `make clean-debug`.\
 To clean everything, including build directories, run `make extraclean`.

 ## Running

 After installing, SnapsInAZfs can be run from any shell, so long as your `$PATH` includes
 the  `/usr/local/sbin` directory and the system has the same version of .net installed as SnapsInAZfs was
 built on. The Makefile will not modify your PATH variable, as it shouldn't be necessary on most distros, since 
 SnapsInAZfs is installed in a common binary path. If `/usr/local/sbin` is not in your PATH, you should add it at
 least for the users intended to run it, or system-wide, if you so desire.
 
 ## Dependencies

 SIAZ has no external run-time dependencies for core functionality other than the required version of the dotnet runtime
 and ZFS itself that have to be manually installed by the end user.
 
 Compile-time dependencies are included as project references in the dotnet projects, and will be retrieved by the dotnet SDK, from the public NuGet repository, upon build.

 ## Configuration

 Base application settings, including global program options, template definitions, and logging settings for SIAZ are in JSON-formatted files. See `snapsinazfs(5)` after install for detailed documentation.\
 All other configuration is specified in ZFS user properties, for options that apply to how SIAZ interacts with your datasets. See `snapsinazfs-zfsprops(7)` after install for detailed documentation.\

 ## Getting Help

 SIAZ comes with man pages that are installed when you run `make install`.\
 These man pages are:
 - snapsinazfs(8)
 - snapsinazfs(5)
 - snapsinazfs-zfsprops(7)
 - snapsinazfs-config-console(8)
 
 If you find a bug or odd behavior in SIAZ, issues can be filed here. Note, however, that this is not a technical
 support board and SIAZ is not a commercial product, and there are no warranties, implied or otherwise. This
 includes support. While I will do my best to help out, if an issue is filed and is more than just asking for
 configuration help or similar, there is no guarantee your issue will ever be fixed, addressed, or even seen.\
 Unless, of course, you want to sponsor me with a fat check. Then I might consider giving you priority. ;)

 Constructive criticism, suggestions, and feature requests are always welcome, though they are at my or other
 contributors' discretion to address, implement, etc.

 ## Contributing

 I'm more than happy to have anyone contribute to the project.

 If pull requests are submitted, when I have time, I will happily review and merge those that don't deviate from
 the core mission of the project in a significant way, and that don't completely duplicate something I'm already
 currently working on (that case should be uncommon, though, as I generally commit and push often).

 If you intend to contribute, please adhere to the code style of the project, which generally follows standard
 recommendations for C#, with small deviations if and when I think they improve the readability of the code.\
 I have included ReSharper settings files that reflect the general formatting rules used.
 
 If you happen to _really_ want to contribute to this project in a major way, I'm happy to collaborate. For now,
 though, I would prefer for such collaboration to occur via pull requests from a fork of this repository, branched
 from the master branch or a branch specifically created for a reported issue.
